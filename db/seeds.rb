# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


articles = Article.create([{title: "Dog", content: "My friend"}, {title: "Cat", content: "My buddy"}])





# require "faker"

# # p "Destroying Articles"
# Article.destroy_all

# 10.times do
#   title = Faker::Book.title,
#   content = Faker::Book.author
